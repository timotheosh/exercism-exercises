With conditionals, it is important to use the most specific conditional to the implementation. When there are only one possible non-nil outcome, use `when` or `unless`. For two possible non-nil outcomes, use `if`. For three or more possible non-nil outcomes, use `cond`. Also remember that anytime none of the conditions are met, `nil` is the default result, you almost never need to explicitly return it.
