Please do not leave lines with just closing parenthesis. This is very bad form in Lisp. I know it is common place to do just this in other languages such as C/C++ and Java, but Lisp is really quite different. The closing parenthesis in Lisp is more a (necessary) formality and adds nothing to the readability of the code. That is why we pile them on, on the last line of a block of code. Eventually, to the reader, they'll become invisible.
